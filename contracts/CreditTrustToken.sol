/*
  Overview (for this PR):
  - This is a simple, non-transferable "credit badge" NFT that we mint after a borrower repays.
  - The tokenURI is a placeholder for now.

  What weâ€™ll tighten in a follow-up PR (not blocking this one):
  - Make it truly "soulbound": block approvals and regular transfers; allow only admin burn for disputes.
  - Store/track a borrower "score" (e.g., +1 per successful repayment) and expose it for reads.
  - Replace the static tokenURI with borrower-specific metadata (e.g., IPFS per borrower or on-chain JSON).
  - Only the LoanRegistry should be allowed to mint.
