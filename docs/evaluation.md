## Evaluation

We evaluate this project based on the functional requirements and document where the current build meets or diverges from the original goals.

### Requirement Fulfillment

#### Telegram Bot Interface
- **FR-1 – User Registration on `/start`**: *Partially met*. The bot creates a user record and greets the user, but wallet creation now lives under `/create_wallet`, so registration no longer provisions an XRPL account within the command.
- **FR-2 – List Commands with `/help`**: *Partially met*. The help task enumerates all supported commands with a usage example, but it does not group them by category as the requirement specified.
- **FR-3 – Balance Inquiry with `/balance`**: *Met*. The balance task validates the user, fetches a live XRPL balance, and responds with the value in XRP. Fiat equivalents are optional and skipped.
- **FR-4 – XRP Transfers with `/send`**: *Partially met*. Transfers validate sender, recipient, and funds, persist a transaction record, sign via XRPL, and report success to the sender. There is no confirmation prompt, recipient notification, or fee breakdown.
- **FR-5 – Historical Price Queries with `/price`**: *Partially met*. The bot supports date-range queries with ISO or day ranges and limits the window to 90 days, but it does not accept relative phrases (e.g., “last month”), lacks the five-year span due to API limits, and the response omits min/max/avg summaries.
- **FR-6 – Error Handling**: *Met*. Each task returns friendly error messages and handles third-party failures gracefully (e.g., API timeouts). Rate-limit messaging is still absent.
- **FR-7 – Standard Telegram Commands**: *Not met*. Only `/start` and `/help` are registered. `/settings` and `/cancel` are unimplemented since they were not needed for core flows.

#### XRPL Account Management
- **FR-8 – Wallet Generation**: *Partially met*. Wallets are generated and encrypted via **Fernet** when users issue `/create_wallet`, but the requirement expected this to happen automatically on `/start` with a ≤5s guarantee, which we no longer satisfy or measure.
- **FR-9 – Initial Funding**: *Partially met*. The faucet-funded wallet typically arrives with ≥10 XRP, yet there is no retry loop or explicit balance verification before notifying the user.
- **FR-10 – Secure Key Management**: *Met*. Secrets are encrypted with Fernet using an environment-provided key and only decrypted for signing.
- **FR-11 – Balance Monitoring**: *Partially met*. Live balances are queried from XRPL per request, but there is no caching strategy or post-transfer change tracking, the latter being unnecessary without a persistent balance display.
- **FR-12 – Transaction Execution**: *Partially met*. Transactions are signed securely and persisted with status updates, yet we do not expose fee calculations, notify recipients, or offer rollback beyond marking a transfer failed.

#### Historical Price Data
- **FR-13 – CoinGecko Integration**: *Partially met*. The worker hits CoinGecko’s market-chart endpoints and surfaces API errors, but frequent query caching and explicit rate-limit handling remain TODOs.
- **FR-14 – Date Validation**: *Partially met*. ISO dates and positive day windows are validated with start-before-end checks, though natural language ranges are unsupported and the max window is capped at 90 days.
- **FR-15 – Data Presentation**: *Partially met*. Responses list daily USD/ZAR prices with percent change and warnings, but min/max/avg statistics and user-selectable currency preferences are not implemented.

### Non-Functional Requirement Fulfillment

- **Security:**  
  - Fernet encryption for keys - Met
  - No sensitive info in logs - Met
  - HTTPS for all communications - Met
  - Prevent injection attacks - Met

- **Performance:**  
  - Response time ≤ 2s under normal load - Met
  - Indexed queries, caching for price/balance lookups - Partially met (no caching yet)

- **Reliability:**  
  - 99% uptime during business hours (We don't have business hours) - N/A
  - Retry mechanisms for failed operations - Partially met (no explicit retries implemented)
  - Atomic, consistent transactions - Met

- **Testability:**  
  - Unit tests for core logic - Unmet (No tests yet)  
  - Integration tests for XRPL and CoinGecko  - Unmet (No tests yet)
  - Mockable APIs, separate test/production DBs - Not met (Single DB, no mocks)

- **Deployability:**  
  - Packaged with Docker, `.env`-based config - Met  
  - Automated migrations - Met 
  - Zero-downtime deploys and documented rollback - Not met (No CI/CD yet)
  - Deploy to Render.com or similar platform - Met


### Final Notes on Evaluation
Overall, the project meets many core functional requirements but falls short of full compliance in several areas, particularly around user experience polish, error handling, and test coverage. Non-functional goals around security and performance are largely satisfied, though reliability and deployability need further work. Future iterations should prioritize completing partial features, adding tests, and implementing caching and retry strategies to enhance robustness.
