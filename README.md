# LendX: Decentralised Micro-Lending Platform (FTC 2025)

Welcome to **LendX**, the foundation for our ECO5037S (FTC) class project. This repository will evolve into a proof-of-concept platform that explores how decentralised infrastructure and alternative data can unlock affordable credit for South Africans who are underserved by traditional credit systems.

> **Project Vision:** Build an end-to-end lending experience that connects thin-file borrowers and community lenders through open banking data, a Python-based credit scoring engine, smart escrow contracts on the XRPL EVM sidechain, and user-friendly touchpoints such as a Telegram bot and web portal.

---

## 🧭 Project Roadmap

The project brief highlights the following goals:

1. **Data-Driven Creditworthiness**
   - Collect user-permissioned banking data via an Absa-inspired Open Banking API.
   - Generate alternative credit scores for thin-file clients using a transparent Python scoring engine.
2. **Decentralised Lending Mechanics**
   - Deploy smart contracts on the XRPL EVM sidechain to escrow funds, issue loans, manage repayments, and mint non-transferable **CreditTrust Tokens** that reflect repayment behaviour.
   - Explore cross-chain bridges (Axelar, Squid Router) where relevant for liquidity routing.
3. **User-Facing Experiences**
   - **Telegram Bot:** Facilitate borrower and lender onboarding, loan requests, approvals, and repayment notifications.
   - **Web Platform:** Surface smart contract activity, portfolio analytics, and provide a portal for technically savvy lenders to supply liquidity.

Throughout the semester we will iterate on architecture, smart contract design, UI flows, and operational processes. Expect substantial changes as we validate assumptions and integrate feedback from the product and management teams.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Current State)

We are beginning with the existing Django + Telegram bot foundation. Use the Makefile and Docker setup for consistent development environments.

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) **or**
- Python 3.11+, PostgreSQL 16, and your preferred virtual environment manager
- Git for version control
- Make for task automation (optional but recommended), if you don't have it, you can run the commands manually.
- Ngrok for local webhook testing (Please sign up for a free account to get a personal auth token)

### Quick Start with Docker
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/marclevin/ftc-lendx.git
# Move into the project directory
cd ftc-lendx

# Copy and configure environment variables
 cp .env.example .env
# Update secrets such as DJANGO_SECRET_KEY and TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN with actual values

# Optionally run ngrok for webhook testing
# Replace YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN with your actual token from your ngrok account.
# You can find your auth token after logging into the ngrok dashboard at https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken
ngrok authtoken YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN
ngrok http 8000 # Keep this running in a separate terminal
# Either copy the forwarding URL and paste it in your ENV via PUBLIC_URL or set it directly:
export PUBLIC_URL=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io
# Build and run services
 make up
 # If you don't have Make, use:
 # docker-compose -f compose/docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```
Services default to:
- Django backend: http://localhost:8000
- PostgreSQL: localhost:5433 (adjust as needed in `compose/docker-compose.dev.yml`)

### Helpful Make Targets
```bash
make logs            # Tail application logs
make up              # Start services
make down            # Stop services
make setwebhook      # Set Telegram bot webhook (requires PUBLIC_URL)
make migrate         # Apply database migrations
```

## 📝 Documentation & Deliverables

Keep project documentation in the `docs/` directory. Over the term, we will produce:

- **Project & Technical Specification** (market research, requirements, user stories, UI mockups, architecture diagrams, technology choices)
- **Lessons Learnt Report** (individual reflection)
- **Proof of Concept** (this repository + deployed demo)
- **Presentation & Demo** showcasing the solution

Upcoming course deadlines:
- **10 Oct:** Specification check-in
- **17 Oct:** Final specification submission
- **24 Oct:** POC check-in
- **31 Oct:** POC + presentation demo
- **3 Nov:** Final submission

## 🔭 Next Steps

- Set up research sprints to understand user needs, regulatory constraints, and technical feasibility (open banking, XRPL EVM).
- Begin prototyping the credit scoring engine, Telegram bot flow, and smart contract architecture.

This README will evolve alongside the project. Update it regularly to reflect the latest architecture, setup steps, and learnings so new contributors can onboard quickly.

## 🤝 Contributing

1. **Branching**  
   - For each issue, create a new branch using GitHub’s default naming convention (e.g., `15-workflow-branching-strategy`).  
   - Branch names should clearly reference the issue number and purpose.

2. **Commits**  
   - Write short, descriptive commit messages using clear language (e.g., “Add Celery task for wallet creation”).  
   - Avoid vague terms like “fix stuff” or “update”.

3. **Pull Requests (PRs)**  
   - Once your feature or fix is ready, open a PR to merge into `main`. 
   - Another team member **must review and approve** your PR before merging.

4. **Collaboration**  
   - If you find gaps or have suggestions, open an issue or start a discussion.  
   - This repo is meant to evolve as our understanding grows.
